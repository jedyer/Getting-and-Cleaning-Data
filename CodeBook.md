## Data Set Information

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.  Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## File Information	

After downloading and unzipping the data, the following files are used to create the tidy dataset:
	
	*activity_labels.txt
	*features.txt
	*subject_test.txt
	*X_test.txt
	*Y_test.txt
	*subject_train.txt
	*X_train.txt
	*Y_train.txt

## Transformations

The following transformations were applied to the data:

	1.  The test and training sets for X,Y,and subject were merged together to create 3 new datasets
	2.  Column names are added to the merged X dataset and then filtered to have only columns with "mean" or "std" in the column name.
	3.  Descriptive column names are added to the merged Y and subject datasets
	4.  The merged X,Y, and subject datasets are merged into one dataset
	5.  The combined dataset is converted to a tidy dataset
	6.  The tidy dataset is written as a text file "tidy_data.txt" to the working directory
